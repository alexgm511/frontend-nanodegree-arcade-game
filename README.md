The objective of the game is to get the character to the water before getting run over by the enemies speeding across.
The character is moved up, down, left or right using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

The game consists of the index.html file, three javascript files: app.js, engine.js and resources.js, a style.css file and the image files that make up the game.
